Homework #3: Spanning Tree Algorithm
In this homework, you are asked to write a MATLAB program to find the

adjacency matrix of the spanning tree via the spanning tree algorithm in the

lecture notes. Please download the adjacency matrix of network A

(network_A.mat that contains a 100×100 matrix named “A”) on eLearn.

The matrix A is the adjacency matrix of a network with 100 nodes.

A(i,j)=1, if there is an edge between nodes i and j and 0 otherwise.

Node “1” is root.

Please use matrix A to find the adjacency matrix t of the spanning tree via the spanning tree algorithm in the lecture notes.

matrix t is the adjacency matrix of the spanning tree and t(i,j)=1 if there is an edge between nodes i and j in the tree and 0

otherwise.

Upload two files to eLearn.(Please code by matlab.)

source code file named “code.m”


result data file named “result.mat” that contains the following spanning tree matrix named “tree”.

Other requirement:

You should use “load” to get inputdata. Programs should have comments.
